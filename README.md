# SUBOR

This is first semi successful attempt at writting a NES emulator. ~~Does not support sound yet, and only does mapper 0~~ (does support sound and supports a few simple mappers) :). However its a ~~work in progress so anything can happen~~ (I'm working on FPGA version now). It's called Subor because the first NES i owned wasn't a NES, but a famiclone named Subor.
